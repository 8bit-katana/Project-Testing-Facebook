For the final project for my Software Testing course at "Școala Informală de IT", I have chosen to test the web version of the Facebook application and make a summary of the whole process. 
Feel free to take a look at it!

The Testing Facebook Presentation.pptx file contains the presentation of the whole process.

The Facebook Test Data Set.xlsx file contains every Test Case performed along with the corresponding data for each test. 

In order to view the files, click file name > click View Raw and check the Downloads section in your browser.
